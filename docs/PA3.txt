For this project, we are going to be using Node, Express, and React. Running the application will concurrently start the backend and frontend server while Express serves as a middleware that communicates with both ends. 

We’ve found out that using this stack is extremely popular among web developers and there were an abundance of resources available for us to use. In addition, npm allows us to use open-source software packages developed by many community members, which means that we do not have to waste time and resources on every single feature as there are many tools out there that are already available. This is one of the primary reasons why we favored Node over Flask.

Because of some of our group members’ experience with React, we’ve decided to go with this library to build user interfaces. In addition, due to its ability to reuse UI components and its overall ease of use, we believe that this library will greatly benefit our project.
