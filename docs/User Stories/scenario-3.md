User Story: I want to register an account for the “sports-sentiment-analysis”

Actor: New user / Unregistered user

“As a new user, I want to register so that I can access the app’s features which are contained in the application dashboard.”

Scenario A:

I press a button that leads me to the registration page where it asks for my basic information. 
I create my username and password. 
The page will direct me to the main dashboard, and ~~I can add my favorite team / teams that I want to focus on.~~” 

Scenario B (If username already exists / Weak password):

The page will let me know if the username is already taken or if my password is too weak. 
After I make the appropriate changes (if necessary), the page will direct me to the main dashboard, and I can add my favorite team / teams that I want to focus on.” 

Final outcome: Access to the full site
