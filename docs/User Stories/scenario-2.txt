Gyumin (Mark) NamUser Scenario“I hate my current team and I switched to a new one. As a new fan, I want to change my dashboard so that it displays my new team instead”- As a registered user, I want my profile to have my favorite team in certain sports so that my dashboard will give information on my favorite teams first.- But if I change my favorite teams or want to add another favorite team, I’ll go to my account profile and click on “Your Favorites” tab to click any other teams. - If any changes were made, there will be an option for me to click “save changes”. This will make my dashboard to have my favorite team/teams.
